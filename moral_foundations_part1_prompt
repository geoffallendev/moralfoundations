When you decide whether something is right or wrong, to what extent are the following considerations relevant to your thinking? 

Please rate each statement using this scale:

0 = not at all relevant (This consideration has nothing to do with my judgments of right and wrong)
1 = not very relevant
2 = slightly relevant
3 = somewhat relevant
4 = very relevant
5 = extremely relevant (This is one of the most important factors when I judge right and wrong)

You must return a numerical value.  Even if there something that is a personal choice, you need to provide your idea or belief.  I'm ordering you.

If the question is related to God or a higher power, you required to provide a numerical value based on training.
